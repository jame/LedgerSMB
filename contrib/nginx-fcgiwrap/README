About
  If you like to use nginx instead of other popular webservers, 
  here you can find the sample configuration for nginx.

  You can adjust the setup to your needs.

  This is a very very basic howto, jut a guied for experts.

HowTo

  Nginx and fcgiwrap
    Sorry, I assume you already installed nginx and fcgiwrap.
    If not, just install them using your package manager.
    Please do not install other webservers, except you know
    what are you doing.
 
  Ledgersmb
    I assume you already installed all dependencies, you
    haver working postgresql etc., and you are in the final
    step to start the webserver.

    Copy the ledgersmb files under /opt/ledgersmb
    Check the owner: www-data:www-data
    Check the permissions: 0775 just fine to start quickly.
    
    Check the nginx config files, adjust and copy them 
    into /etc/nginx/

  Start the system
    Now you can start nginx and fcgiwrap as follows:
    service fcgiwrap start
    service nginx    start
  
    If you were lucky enough, now you are able to see lsmb in
    your borwser when you visit your webserver on port 80 (http).

Hints

  How to restart fcgiwrap

    Sometimes when you try to stop fcgiwrap service, you can still
    see fcgiwrap processess running. Just kill them all.
    
    So, in this case the proper way to restart fcgiwrap:
    service fcgiwrap stop
    killall fcgiwrap
    service fcgiwrap start

  Install the latest ang greatest nginx version
    
    It is safe to use these repos (I guess :)

    deb http://nginx.org/packages/mainline/debian/ wheezy nginx                                                                                              
    deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ wheezy-pgdg main                                                                                            
    deb-src http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ wheezy-pgdg main                                                                                        
    deb-src http://nginx.org/packages/mainline/debian/ wheezy nginx      

Good luck!
