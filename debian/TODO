debian/TODO for LedgerSMB ledgersmb-1.5 package


====================================================================================================

Update debian/Readme.Debian as necessary.
Update debian/Readme.sources as necessary.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- lintian results from pkg build for beta6

  - This is because the new debconf question has not been translated yet.
I: ledgersmb-1.5 source: no-complete-debconf-translation

  - This is because the new debconf question isn't used in the maintainer scripts
    as yet.
I: ledgersmb-1.5: unused-debconf-template ledgersmb-1.5/lsmb_proxy

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Add a get-orig-source target added to debian rules ?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- App::LedgerSMB::DBAdmin is still needed for it's library functions, even though
 it's an app not just a module.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- debian/watch: expand the uversionmangle regular expression to exclude the v1.2,
v1.3, and v1.4 versions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- A debian/po debconf Japanese translation has been provided. Currently,
there is no LSMB locale/po/ja.po file. Checked System|Lanaguage|List
Languages in LSMB 1.3.40: "ja" is not in the default list. It's also not
listed as an available language when editing templates, and presumably
those lists come from the same source. It can be added manually using
System|Language|Add Language. 

- Upstream uses pdflatex to create the distribution LedgerSMB-manual.pdf from
the source file doc/manual/LedgerSMB-manual.tex. Use the same source file to
create an HTML version?

- Create an HTML and/or PDF file of templateing/templating-guide.tex? And
then register it with doc-base?

- Instead of a sym link to point to the /etc/ledgersmb config file(s), 
patch config file to add '/etc/' to the config file setting. (Would
the apache config also need to be updated to allow that?)
